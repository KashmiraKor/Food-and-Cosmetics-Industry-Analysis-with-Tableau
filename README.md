# Food-and-Cosmetics-Industry-Analysis-with-Tableau

## Overview

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of the CFSAN Adverse Event Reporting System (CAERS) dataset using Tableau. The dataset includes reports submitted to the FDA regarding adverse events and product complaints associated with foods, dietary supplements, and cosmetics from 2004 to the second quarter of 2017. The analysis aims to uncover trends and patterns in adverse events, contributing to enhanced product safety surveillance and regulatory policies.
